# Directory containing CA certificates in PEM format. The files each contain one
# CA certificate. The files are looked up by the CA subject name hash value,
# which must hence be available. If more than one CA certificate with the same
# name hash value exist, the extension must be different (e.g. 9d66eef0.0,
# 9d66eef0.1 etc). The search is performed in the ordering of the extension
# number, regardless of other properties of the certificates. Use the c_rehash
# utility to create the necessary links.
#
# The certificates in the directory are only looked up when required, e.g. when
# building the certificate chain or when actually performing the verification
# of a peer certificate. The contents of the directory can thus be changed
# without an agent restart.
#
# When looking up CA certificates, the verify_cert_file is first searched, then
# those in the directory. Certificate matching is done based on the subject name,
# the key identifier (if present), and the serial number as taken from the
# certificate to be verified. If these data do not match, the next certificate
# will be tried. If a first certificate matching the parameters is found, the
# verification process will be performed; no other certificates for the same
# parameters will be searched in case of failure.
#
# Note that if neither verify_cert_file or verify_cert_dir is set, certificate
# verification will not be performed.
